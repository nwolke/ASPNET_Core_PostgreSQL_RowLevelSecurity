# ASPNET_Core_PostgreSQL_RowLevelSecurity

## Purpose
This project is to showcase my solution for creating dynamic connection strings needed for connecting to a PostgreSQL database that is setup for Row Level Security.

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to unit or supply an integration test for this solution as it requires a PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security setup on it. I will provide some simple instructions though on how to set up one.

#### PostgreSQL SETUP
Follow the instructions at this link to setup a PostgreSQL DB on Windows: https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=installPostgreSQLWindows
